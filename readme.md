## **ℹ️ About**
The Whanos project undertaken in the Third year at [{Epitech}](https://www.epitech.eu/) Whanos is an infrastructure that allows any developer to automatically deploy an application into a
cluster, just by a push to their Git repository

## **📑 Project Info**
- [📦 Epitech private repository]()
- [📦 Group remote repository]()
- [📄 PDF Project](https://intra.epitech.eu/module/2024/B-DOP-500/NAN-5-1/acti-648235/project/file/B-DOP-500_whanos.pdf)

### **📃 Description**

Following a push to a Whanos-compatible repository, it will perform the following steps

       1. Fetches the Git repository.
       2. Analyses its content to determine its technology.
       3. Containerizes the application into an image, based on both a Whanos image, and an even-
       tual user-provided image customization.
       4. Pushes the image into a Docker registry.
       5. If a valid whanos.yml file exists, deploys the image into a cluster following the given configur-
       ation.

### ⚠️ MUST
```
In order for a repository to be usable within the Whanos infrastructure, it must contain a single
application (written in a supported language), whose source code and resources are in an app
directory placed at the root of the repository
```
